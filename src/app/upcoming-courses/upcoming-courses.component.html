                                    the different types of testing on an agile effort, and understanding
                                    how business, development, and testing personnel best collaborate on
                                    an agile development cadence.

                                    Track. This certification focuses primarily on agile testing techniques and
                                    processes in addition to the mindset and role of an agile tester.
                                    Learning outcomes include the ability to distinguish and “agilize”
                                    the different types of testing on an agile effort, and understanding
                                    how business, development, and testing personnel best collaborate on
                                    an agile development cadence.

                                    pre-deployment, and production support testing.

                                    The ICP-ATA is one of two knowledge-based certifications on the Agile Testing Track.
                                    The certification focuses primarily on test automation from an agile tester’s
                                    perspective
                                    as opposed to a programmer’s perspective. Students will learn how to set up an
                                    overall test
                                    automation strategy, including determining which types of tests are better suited
                                    for automated
                                    versus manual execution. The certification also highlights strategies for creating
                                    automated
                                    story and feature tests as well as system and integration tests. Because courses are
                                    technology-agnostic,
                                    participants will write automated tests using pseudo-code in the classroom.


                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                                    This also helps maximize
                                    opportunities for students to learn from one another, regardless of their individual
                                    technical expertise.
                                    If you are ready to increase your knowledge about the world of test automation, this
                                    is the
                                    right certification for you.

                                    The two-day, interactive SAFe® DevOps course helps people across technical,

                                    and leadership roles work together to optimize their value stream from end to end.
                                    Attendees will learn what DevOps is, why it is important to every role, and design a
                                    continuous delivery pipeline that is tailored to their business. Attendees work in
                                    cross-functional teams to map their current state value stream from concept to cash,
                                    identify major bottlenecks to flow, and build an actionable
                                    implementation plan that will accelerate the benefits of DevOps in their
                                    organization.

                                    The ICP-ATA is one of two knowledge-based certifications on the Agile Testing Track.
                                    The certification focuses primarily on test automation from an agile tester’s
                                    perspective
                                    as opposed to a programmer’s perspective. Students will learn how to set up an
                                    overall test
                                    automation strategy, including determining which types of tests are better suited
                                    for automated
                                    versus manual execution. The certification also highlights strategies for creating
                                    automated
                                    story and feature tests as well as system and integration tests. Because courses are
                                    technology-agnostic,
                                    participants will write automated tests using pseudo-code in the classroom.


                                </p>
                                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
                                    This also helps maximize
                                    opportunities for students to learn from one another, regardless of their individual
                                    technical expertise.
                                    If you are ready to increase your knowledge about the world of test automation, this
                                    is the
                                    right certification for you.

                                    The ICP-ATA is one of two knowledge-based certifications on the Agile Testing Track.
                                    The certification focuses primarily on test automation from an agile tester’s
                                    perspective
                                    as opposed to a programmer’s perspective. Students will learn how to set up an
                                    overall test
                                    automation strategy, including determining which types of tests are better suited
                                    for automated
                                    versus manual execution. The certification also highlights strategies for creating
                                    automated
                                    story and feature tests as well as system and integration tests. Because courses are
                                    technology-agnostic,
                                    participants will write automated tests using pseudo-code in the classroom.

                                    This also helps maximize
                                    opportunities for students to learn from one another, regardless of their individual
                                    technical expertise.
                                    If you are ready to increase your knowledge about the world of test automation, this
                                    is the
                                    right certification for you.

                                    participants will write automated tests using pseudo-code in the classroom.
